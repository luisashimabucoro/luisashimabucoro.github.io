Hey/Oi! I'm Luísa, and I'm currently working as a Research Intern at Cohere and I was previously a Research Scholar @ Cohere For AI where I worked with Sara Hooker, Marzieh Fadaee and Julia Kreutzer. Currently, I'm working on uncovering post-training dynamics of multilingual models alongside Sebastian Ruder and Ahmet Üstün. My research interests are, broadly speaking, data-centric modelling, generalization on low-resource settings and robust evaluation design. On that note, I'm also a last-year undergrad and activelly looking for PhD student positions.
